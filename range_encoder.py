Topcoder problem:

Problem Statement
You are given a arr that contains a set of positive integers. The elements in arr are all distinct and they are given in increasing order.

A range is a finite set of consecutive integers. Formally, for any two positive integers a ≤ b the range [a,b] is defined to be the set of all integers that lie between a and b, inclusive. For example, [3,3] = {3} and [4,7] = {4,5,6,7}.

You want to represent the set given in arr as a union of some ranges. Return the minimum number of ranges you need.

Definition
Class: RangeEncoding
Method: minRanges
Parameters: tuple (integer)
Returns: integer
Method signature: def minRanges(self, arr):
Limits
Time limit (s): 2.000
Memory limit (MB): 256
Constraints
- arr will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
- Each element of arr will be between 1 and 50.
- The elements in arr will be in strictly increasing order.
Examples
0)
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Returns: 1
We can represent this set as a single range [1,10].
1)
{1,6,10,20,32,49}
Returns: 6
In this case we have to use 6 different ranges, each containing just a single number.
2)
{2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,15}
Returns: 4
This set of integers can be represented as the union of four ranges: [2,2], [4,6], [8,12], and [15,15].
3)
{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47}
Returns: 14
4)
{10,11,12,13,14,15,20,21,22,23,25,27,28,29,30,31,32,33}
Returns: 4
5)
{33}
Returns: 1
